# Ascent

## Attack

### A Site - fast execute

**Note**: this version is in between "walk contact" speed and "run it down" speed. Best used when your team is executing quickly but still needs a couple seconds to take A Main control.

### A Site - walk contact

**Note**: this version is best for walk contact, as it does take some time to set up. The advantage is that you can immediately grab the orb and can more quickly rejoin your team. That being said, most of the time contacting up won't be possible, so the Fast Execute lineups are more practical to learn first.

Take note of this intersection of bricks above the middle wood arch:

#### Heaven

Aim at the tip of this cloud in the sky:
![20250608022338.png](/screenshots/20250608022338.png)
**Note**: the lineup is relatively lenient, as the back wall helps bounce the Ice Orb onto Heaven.

### A Site - round start

**Note**: this is the fastest possible version. This is best when you know your team will execute fast _and_ your team has mobility duelists such as Jett, Neon, etc.

Tuck between the box and the round start barrier:

## Defense

### From Tree to A Main orb

**Note**: use this when you have a hard read on an A Main push and your team wants to fight A Main. Great to combo with a molly lineup on the ult orb.

Tuck into this corner:
![20250612133204.png](/screenshots/20250612133204.png)
Take note of this dark leaf in the sky:
![20250612133033.png](/screenshots/20250612133033.png)
Line up your crosshair with the top left of that dark leaf:
![20250612133235.png](/screenshots/20250612133235.png)
Result:
![20250612133303.png](/screenshots/20250612133303.png)

For an easier lineup, you can aim directly into the gap above the dark leaf:
![20250612133329.png](/screenshots/20250612133329.png)
Result:
![20250612133411.png](/screenshots/20250612133411.png)

**Tradeoff**: this covers the nook that people like to hide in, but covers less of A Lobby, so you may want to include a one-way smoke.

### From Tree to B Site execute

Tuck into this corner:
![20250612125512.png](/screenshots/20250612125512.png)
Notice these pair of leaves to the right of the scoped crosshair:
![20250612131501.png](/screenshots/20250612131501.png)
**Note**: an easy way to remember is that your crosshair is horizontally aligned with the dark leaf on the left.

Tuck the right side of your crosshair (if using a plus symbol) in between those two leaves:
![20250612131524.png](/screenshots/20250612131524.png)
Result:
![20250612131601.png](/screenshots/20250612131601.png)

For a simpler lineup, just aim slightly above the bottom leaf:
![20250612131635.png](/screenshots/20250612131635.png)
Result:
![20250612131710.png](/screenshots/20250612131710.png)

**Tradeoff**: you slow more of Lane but less of Logs.

### A Site retake

#### Generator

Tuck into this corner:
![20250626164103.png](/screenshots/20250626164103.png)
**Note**: don't jump on the boxes.

Notice the `>` symbol or Pacman of green leaves to the right of the crosshair:
![20250626164155.png](/screenshots/20250626164155.png)

The separator bar between the Wall and Slow symbols; tuck the right side of it into the Pacman leaves:
![20250626164235.png](/screenshots/20250626164235.png)
Result:
![20250626164330.png](/screenshots/20250626164330.png)

#### Hell / Dice

Notice the bottom left of this alarm box:
![20250626170857.png](/screenshots/20250626170857.png)

Put the bottom left of the tilde UI on the bottom left of the alarm box:
![20250626170934.png](/screenshots/20250626170934.png)
**Note**: err slightly upwards, since if you are too far down then you might accidentally slow Heaven.

Result:

## Honorable Mentions

### A Site

#### Generator (trapped behind smoke)

**Note**: use this when your team is temporarily trapped behind smoke, but team is soon to be executing onto site (e.g. Phoenix is equipping a Flash into his hands).

Tuck in this corner:
![20250518234437.png](/screenshots/20250518234437.png)
Aim anywhere at this vertical line above the generator:
![20250518234600.png](/screenshots/20250518234600.png)
**Note**: as long as the Ice Orb is thrown above the generator, then it will bounce roughly into the same spot.
Example result:
