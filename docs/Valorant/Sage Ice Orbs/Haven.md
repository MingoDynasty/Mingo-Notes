# Attack

## A Site

### A Long

Tuck into this corner:

Aim slightly to the right of this roof, but at the tip of the trees:

Result:

### Back site

Tuck into this corner:
![20250519011046.png](/screenshots/20250519011046.png)
Aim slightly left and above the corner of this roof:

Result:

### Back site (easy)

Stand at the bottom of A Long, and aim anywhere at this wooden frame, above the site box:
![20250519011746.png](/screenshots/20250519011746.png)
A good rule of thumb is to aim at the wire:
![20250519011943.png](/screenshots/20250519011943.png)
This is so you throw it high enough that it goes over the site box, but not too high that it bounces back at you.

### Heaven (Version 1)

Stand on top of this wheelbarrow:
![20250519021338.png](/screenshots/20250519021338.png)
Aim at this flower:
![20250519021420.png](/screenshots/20250519021420.png)
Jump, and after the apex of your jump (i.e. while falling), throw the Ice Orb.

### Heaven (Version 2)

Hug this wall:
![20250519011350.png](/screenshots/20250519011350.png)

Aim anywhere above the orange stripe, but within the window:

### CT Spawn

Tuck into this corner:
![20250519012432.png](/screenshots/20250519012432.png)
Aim slightly above this box, and slightly to the right of the wall:
![20250519012500.png](/screenshots/20250519012500.png)
This is just so you avoid accidentally bouncing the Ice Orb off the wall and into your team's push

# Defense

### A Site stall / retake

Tuck into this corner:
![20250519020944.png](/screenshots/20250519020944.png)

Aim anywhere along this orange stripe, at the top half of it:
![20250519021019.png](/screenshots/20250519021019.png)
Result:
![20250519021039.png](/screenshots/20250519021039.png)

### A Long stall from C Site

Hug the left side of this wooden frame:
![20250519023045.png](/screenshots/20250519023045.png)

Follow this wooden frame vertically into the sky:
![20250519023615.png](/screenshots/20250519023615.png)

Run, jump, and throw:
![20250519023644.png](/screenshots/20250519023644.png)

Example result:
![20250519023318.png](/screenshots/20250519023318.png)
**Note**: can also be used to bait the enemy into thinking that Sage is on site with the teammate, while you continue to lurk C Long.

### C Site retake

Tuck into this corner:
![20250610214257.png](/screenshots/20250610214257.png)
Aim slightly below this wood piece sticking out:
![20250610214347.png](/screenshots/20250610214347.png)
**Note**: be careful not to accidentally hit the wood piece nor the wall to your right, else the Ice Orb may accidentally bounce back.
Result:
![20250610214451.png](/screenshots/20250610214451.png)

### C Site stall

Same as retake lineup, but simply aim about 1-2 crosshair lengths lower than the wooden piece, while still keeping your crosshair along the right wall:
![20250610214705.png](/screenshots/20250610214705.png)
Result:
![20250610214853.png](/screenshots/20250610214853.png)
**Note**: this version discourages the enemy team from planting for Long (can easily combo with a Sova ult or something). It can also be useful to help stall for someone holding back site.

### C Site stall from A Site

TODO: move these to honorable mentions

Hug this wall standing in front of this wooden frame:
![20250519015634.png](/screenshots/20250519015634.png)
Trace this wall vertically into the sky:
![20250519015715.png](/screenshots/20250519015715.png)
Run, jump and throw:
![20250519015900.png](/screenshots/20250519015900.png)

Example result:
![20250519015816.png](/screenshots/20250519015816.png)
**Note**: can also be used to bait the enemy into thinking that Sage is on site with the teammate, while you continue to lurk A Long.

# Honorable Mentions

I don't use these often, but they can sometimes be useful to know.

### C Site stall / retake (railing version)

Stand on this and tuck as far upward as you can:
![20250519021724.png](/screenshots/20250519021724.png)
Aim slightly to the left of the bottom light:
![20250519021759.png](/screenshots/20250519021759.png)
Result:
