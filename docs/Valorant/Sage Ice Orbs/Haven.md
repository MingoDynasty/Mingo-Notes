# Haven

## Attack

### A Site

#### A Long

Tuck into this corner:
![20250519010257.png](/screenshots/20250519010257.png)

Aim slightly to the right of this roof, but at the tip of the trees:

Result:

#### Back site

**Note**: sometimes this is slightly too slow if you have mobility duelists (Jett, Raze, Yoru, etc.) who run it down with no util. If you want a faster version, see "Back site (round start)".

Tuck into this corner:
![20250519011046.png](/screenshots/20250519011046.png)

Note this corner of the building:
![20250816071342.png](/screenshots/20250816071342.png)

The separator bar between the Ice Orb and Heart icons; put the left side of this bar onto that corner of windows:

#### Back site (round start)

Stand on top of the 1st level ledge and tuck into the barrier:
![20250816070548.png](/screenshots/20250816070548.png)

Take note of this intersection of bricks:
![20250816070645.png](/screenshots/20250816070645.png)

The separator bar between the Ice Orb and Heart icons; put the right side of this bar into that intersection of bricks:
![20250816070707.png](/screenshots/20250816070707.png)

Result:
![20250816070733.png](/screenshots/20250816070733.png)

#### Back site (easy)

Stand at the bottom of A Long, and aim anywhere at this wooden frame, above the site box:
![20250519011746.png](/screenshots/20250519011746.png)
A good rule of thumb is to aim at the wire:
![20250519011943.png](/screenshots/20250519011943.png)
This is so you throw it high enough that it goes over the site box, but not too high that it bounces back at you.

#### Heaven (Version 1)

Stand on top of this wheelbarrow:
![20250519021338.png](/screenshots/20250519021338.png)
Aim at this flower:
![20250519021420.png](/screenshots/20250519021420.png)
Jump, and after the apex of your jump (i.e. while falling), throw the Ice Orb.
Result:

#### Heaven (Version 2)

Hug this wall:
![20250519011350.png](/screenshots/20250519011350.png)

Aim anywhere above the orange stripe, but within the window:
![20250519011527.png](/screenshots/20250519011527.png)
Result:
![20250519011612.png](/screenshots/20250519011612.png)

#### CT Spawn

Tuck into this corner:
![20250519012432.png](/screenshots/20250519012432.png)
Aim slightly above this box, and slightly to the right of the wall:
![20250519012500.png](/screenshots/20250519012500.png)
This is just so you avoid accidentally bouncing the Ice Orb off the wall and into your team's push
Result:

### C Site

#### Back site (round start)

Tuck into this corner:
![20250708193708.png](/screenshots/20250708193708.png)

Aim at the bottom left of this wooden piece:
![20250708193752.png](/screenshots/20250708193752.png)

**Note:** don't aim too far left that you hit the wall to your left.

Jump, and while falling, throw.
Result:
![20250708193907.png](/screenshots/20250708193907.png)

Slight variation if you want the Ice to be more leftward (e.g. stop someone on Platform from escaping). Take a slight step to the right, while keeping your crosshair aimed at the same spot.

Example result:

#### Back site

Stand along the line of this wall:
![20250519012910.png](/screenshots/20250519012910.png)
Aim at this wooden roof:
![20250519013035.png](/screenshots/20250519013035.png)
Run forward, jump and throw.
Result:

## Defense

### A Site stall / retake

Tuck into this corner:
![20250519020944.png](/screenshots/20250519020944.png)

Aim anywhere along this orange stripe, at the top half of it:
![20250519021019.png](/screenshots/20250519021019.png)
Result:
![20250519021039.png](/screenshots/20250519021039.png)

### C Site retake

Tuck into this corner:
![20250610214257.png](/screenshots/20250610214257.png)
Aim slightly below this wood piece sticking out:
![20250610214347.png](/screenshots/20250610214347.png)
**Note**: be careful not to accidentally hit the wood piece nor the wall to your right, else the Ice Orb may accidentally bounce back.
Result:
![20250610214451.png](/screenshots/20250610214451.png)

### C Site stall

Same as retake lineup, but simply aim about 1-2 crosshair lengths lower than the wooden piece, while still keeping your crosshair along the right wall:
![20250610214705.png](/screenshots/20250610214705.png)
Result:
![20250610214853.png](/screenshots/20250610214853.png)
**Note**: this version discourages the enemy team from planting for Long (can easily combo with a Sova ult or something). It can also be useful to help stall for someone holding back site.

## Honorable Mentions

I don't use these often, but they can sometimes be useful to know.

### A Long stall from C Site

Hug the left side of this wooden frame:
![20250519023045.png](/screenshots/20250519023045.png)

Follow this wooden frame vertically into the sky:
![20250519023615.png](/screenshots/20250519023615.png)

Run, jump, and throw:
![20250519023644.png](/screenshots/20250519023644.png)

Example result:
![20250519023318.png](/screenshots/20250519023318.png)
**Note**: can also be used to bait the enemy into thinking that Sage is on site with the teammate, while you continue to lurk C Long.

### C Site stall / retake (railing version)

This can be useful if you find yourself rotating through CT Spawn.

Stand on this and tuck as far upward as you can:
![20250519021724.png](/screenshots/20250519021724.png)
Aim slightly to the left of the bottom light:
![20250519021759.png](/screenshots/20250519021759.png)
Result:
![20250519021836.png](/screenshots/20250519021836.png)

### C Site stall from A Site

Hug this wall standing in front of this wooden frame:
![20250519015634.png](/screenshots/20250519015634.png)
Trace this wall vertically into the sky:
![20250519015715.png](/screenshots/20250519015715.png)
Run, jump and throw:
![20250519015900.png](/screenshots/20250519015900.png)

Example result:
![20250519015816.png](/screenshots/20250519015816.png)
**Note**: can also be used to bait the enemy into thinking that Sage is on site with the teammate, while you continue to lurk A Long.
