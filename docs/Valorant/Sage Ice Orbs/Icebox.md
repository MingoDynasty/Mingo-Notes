# Icebox

## Attack

### A Site

TODO: Grim Ice Slow into rafters / right side site ?

### B Site

Tuck into this railing in T Spawn:

#### Yellow (version 1, faster execute)

Aim at this star, slightly below:

**Note**: sometimes depending on crosshair, I accidentally aim too high, resulting in it landing on top of Yellow. So I err on the side of a slight pixel below the star.

Result:

#### Yellow (version 2, slower execute)

If you are worried about Yellow while scaling B Long (e.g. enemy team has been playing up close B Long), then you can shift the Ice Slow slightly left, as illustrated below. This slows down your team's scale onto site (i.e. slower to take Yellow control), in exchange for an easier scale up B Long.

Aim in between these two stars:

#### On top of Yellow

Aim to the right of this star:

## Defense

### A Site retake / stall

#### Screens to Generator

Hug this doorway frame:

Aim at this intersection:

Result:

In practice, this lineup is very lenient. Simply using the wall as a backboard is sufficient and will produce similar results.

#### Screens to Maze

Hug this doorway frame:

Aim at this flat part of the ceiling:
