# General Notes

## What can Wall be used for?

Obvious answers:

1. Slowing down a push
2. Locking down a choke point
3. Gaining access to new (typically unexpected) angles

Less obvious answers:

1. Creating additional angles that enemies have to clear, especially a 50/50 close range crossfire with Judges/short-range weapons
2. One-ways
3. Creating a headshot angle or pixel angle
4. 400 credit Cypher trip
5. Vertical wall for extremely safe defuse (enemy has to break through all 4 sections)
6. Vertical wall for extremely difficult defuse (defenders have to break multiple sections to get access to the spike)
7. Fake defensive wall to catch enemies off guard
8. Leaving a gap to bait enemies to peek with big angle disadvantage, or to catch enemies off guard.

Wall is best used when it can serve multiple purposes.

## Getting additional value with your wall for free

Whenever possible, try to incorporate these additions to your wall to get extra value for free.

1. Leaving a nook for a teammate to hide inside, increasing the angles that enemies have to clear.
2. Boosting on top of the wall, as you can always choose to drop down anytime.
3. Utilizing nearby ramps, stairs, or boxes, allowing you to jump back on top of the wall.
4. Using tricks to ensure you get extended walls.
